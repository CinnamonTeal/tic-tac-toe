# tic-tac-toe

this is a simple tic tac toe game, written in Ruby.

the first file, tictactoe.rb was a failed attempt at doing something waaaay more difficult than what was being asked of me,
namely, trying to use the gosu library to great a GUI tic tac toe game.

the second file, tictac2.rb, is a much simpler command line interface tic tac toe game, and it's the one that counts ;)
